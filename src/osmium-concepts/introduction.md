*"Simple things should be simple and complex things should be possible."* - Alan Kay

This manual introduces some concepts that users of the
[Libosmium](http://osmcode.org/libosmium/) C++ library, and the
[pyosmium](http://osmcode.org/pyosmium/) Python bindings and the
[node-osmium](http://osmcode.org/node-osmium/) Node.JS bindings of this library
need to understand to work effectively.

While this manual was written for the users of those libraries it can also be
helpful for users of the [Osmium command line tool](http://osmcode.org/osmium-tool/)
and many other OSM tools, because it contains lots of general information about
the OpenStreetMap data model.
