# OSM Entities

Osmium works with the four basic types of OSM entities: Nodes, Ways, and
Relations (which are all [OSM Objects]) and Changesets. In addition Areas
are supported, which are not native OSM objects, but they are almost treated
like real OSM objects.

These OSM entities can not be created like any normal C++ object, but they
need a buffer to live in. See the next chapter for details. Accessing existing
OSM entities on the other hand is easy and straightforward.

## OSM Objects

Class: `osmium::OSMObject`

Include: `<osmium/osm/object.hpp>`

The `osmium::OSMObject` class is the base class for nodes, ways, and relations.
it has accessors for the usual OSM attributes:

    osmium::OSMObject& obj = ...
    std::cout << "id=" << obj.id()
              << " version=" << obj.version()
              << " timestamp=" << obj.timestamp()
              << " visible=" << (obj.visible() ? "true" : "false"
              << " changeset=" << obj.changeset()
              << " uid=" << obj.uid()
              << " user=" << obj.user() << "\n";

The `changeset()` and `uid()` accessor functions return the IDs of the changeset
that created this object version and the User ID of the user creating this version
of the object, respectively. They do not link to an object of that type.

The `visible` flag will always be true for normal OSM data, but for history data
or change files it shows whether an object version has been deleted.

In addition each object has a list of tags attached:

    const osmium::TagList& tags = obj.tags();

You can iterate over all tags:

    for (const osmium::Tag& tag : obj.tags()) {
        std::cout << tag.key() << "=" << tag.value() << "\n";
    }

Or you can find specific tags:

    const char* highway = obj.tags().get_value_by_key("highway");
    if (highway && !strcmp(highway, "primary") {
        ...
    }


## Nodes

Class: `osmium::Node`

Include: `<osmium/osm/node.hpp>`

A `Node` is a kind of `OSMObject`. In addition to the things you can do with any
OSMObject, the Node has a Location.

    osmium::Node& node = ...
    double longitude = node.location().lon();

## Ways

Classes: `osmium::Way`, `osmium::WayNode`, `osmium::WayNodeList`

Include: `<osmium/osm/way.hpp>`

A `Way` is a kind of `OSMObject`. In addition to the things you can do with any
OSMObject, a Way has a list of node references:

    osmium::Way& way = ...
    for (const osmium::NodeRef& nr : way.nodes()) {
        std::cout << "ref=" << nr.ref() << " location=" << nr.location() << "\n";
    }

## Relations

Classes: `osmium::Relation`, `osmium::RelationMember`, `osmium::RelationMemberList`

Include: `<osmium/osm/relation.hpp>`

A `Relation` is a kind of `OSMObject`. In addition to the things you can do with any
OSMObject, a Relation has a list of members:

    osmium::Relation& relation = ...
    osmium::RelationMemberList& rml = way.members();
    for (osmium::RelationMember& rm : rml) {
        std::cout << rm.type() << rm.ref() << " (role=" << rm.role() << ")\n";
    }

## Areas

*not yet documented*

## Changesets

Class: `osmium:Changeset`

Include: `<osmium/osm/changeset.hpp>`

Changesets contain the metadata for a set of changes to OSM data.
